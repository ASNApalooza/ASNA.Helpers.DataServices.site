              <h2>Walter overview</h2>
                <p>Walter is a component that performs dynamic read-only queries against DataGate databases. It works against physical and logical files. Walter aims to provide a declarative model that makes is easy to fetch performant dynamic query results with a minimal of effort and with a high . It takes about 12 lines of code to configure Walter and produce output with it. When used against the IBM i, Walter consistently produces output in less than 1/10 of a second. </p>

                <p>Walter's query output is driven by output adapters. The default output adapter emits query output as a DataTable. The DataTable can be bound to most Windows and ASP.NET controls (including Windows' DataGridView and ASP.NET's GridView). Walter also includes output adapters to emit query results as: </p>

                <ul class="task-list">
                <li>  <strong>Json</strong>. Walter's Json output can be used in a variety of ways including feeding a JavaScript autocomplete widget (such as jQuery UI's <a href="http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/">AutoComplete</a>) or feeding a client grid such as the jQuery DataTable grid. Walter includes an HTTP handler to make its Json output easy to use with ASP.NET. A small JavaScript wrapper for the jQuery UI AutoComplete widget is included. Using Walter and its components make it very easy to add AutoComplete to your ASP.NET pages (including Wings and Monarch pages). </li>
                <li>  <strong>Excel</strong>. Walter's Excel adapter produces Excel spreadsheets (in XSLX format) on either Windows Web servers or Windows clients, without needing Excel installed. This adapter uses the <a href="https://closedxml.codeplex.com/">ClosedXM</a> library (which itself is a wrapper around MIcrosoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb448854(v=office.15).aspx">Open XML SDK</a>.<br>
                </li>
                <li>  <strong>ListItem array</strong>. This adapter produces a ListItem array for populating ASP.NET's DropDownList controls or Windows's ComboBox. </li>
                </ul><p>Should you need some other output type, it's easy to write your own output adapters by implementing a simple interface that Walter provides.</p>

                <p>To emit the same query to an Excel spreadsheet takes nearly the same code. Line 5 declares an instance of Walter's Excel output adapter and it's instanced on Line 18. Line 19 specifies that the Excel output adapter be used and then, after executing the query, Line 21 saves the spreadsheet to disk. </p>
